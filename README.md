Sorting Hat 

Sorting Hat lets you join your class at Hogwarts! Get sorted, view students by house, and even expel students to Voldemort's Army!


About the User:
- The ideal user for this application is a Harry Potter fanatic!
- The problem this app solves is it allows a user to be sorted randomly into their house.

Features
- When a new student is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of students that then prints to the DOM.
- House Colors: The color of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted.
- Remove individual students from the student array and push them to separate array of Death Eaters, which then prints to the DOM.
- Use redeem to push expelled students back to Hogwarts!
